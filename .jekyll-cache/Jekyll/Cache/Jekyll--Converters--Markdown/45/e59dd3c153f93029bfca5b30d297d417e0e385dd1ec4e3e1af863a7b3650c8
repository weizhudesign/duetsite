<p>Many villages in China have economic backwardness due to historical and location reasons, but they well preserve the style of traditional villages.</p>

<p>The China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation has leveraged its rich experience in township construction to set up a “Baimei Village” project to help the development of China’s remote and impoverished mountain villages and to take the road of rural revitalization.</p>
