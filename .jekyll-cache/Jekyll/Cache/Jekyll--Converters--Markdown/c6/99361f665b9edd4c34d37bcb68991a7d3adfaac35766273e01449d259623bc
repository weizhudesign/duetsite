<p>Brand illustration design for Yili Satine Milk.
Soil, water droplets, sunlight, stars, connect to each other, nourish each other, constitute an authentic, altruistic, symbiotic organic world. Thousands of years ago, our ancestors already understood this. Resources are taken from the nature, fully use and returned to nature. Inspired by this idea, I created a harmony family of dairy farmers and cows.
An real organic world is made up with care and love.
After doing research of classic Mongolian culture, I organized the composition of traditional patterns and modern style.</p>
