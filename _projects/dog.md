# Dog's Year
2018 is the Year of the Dog in China. 
I created this illustration for zcool (a designer website in China) celebrating its 12th anniversary. 
The illustration consists of five cute Chinese garden dogs with different postures. 
I wish anyone who see those dogs feel a touch of happiness.
